# Conserved Contradiction Metrics

Metric system for **measuring, enforcing, and auditing paradox conservation** across recursive scales.

## Purpose
This module extends κ–τ–Σ into paradox space, defining **quantitative invariants** that ensure contradiction persists without collapse or runaway instability.

## Core Metrics
- **Π (Paradox Density)**  
  Amount of unresolved contradiction per unit state volume.

- **ΔΠ (Paradox Gradient)**  
  Directional pressure exerted by contradiction that drives adaptive change.

- **Ξ (Paradox Coherence)**  
  Structural stability of contradiction under transformation and recursion.

- **Ω (Paradox Evaporation Rate)**  
  Controlled fragmentation of paradox across horizons without annihilation.

## Invariants
- Π must never converge to zero under valid evolution.
- ΔΠ must remain bounded to prevent destabilizing oscillation.
- Ξ must exceed a minimum threshold to avoid incoherent contradiction.
- Ω must conserve total paradox mass across horizons.

## Enforcement
- Metric violations trigger governance interrupts, not resolution.
- Metrics are diagnostic and constraining, never optimizing.
- All state transitions are auditable and replayable.

## Interfaces
Consumes:
- Boundary-conditioned states from higher_dimensional_horizons

Emits:
- Paradox constraint vectors to recursive evolution systems
- Audit signals to governance layers

These metrics ensure contradiction remains a **productive, conserved force** rather than noise or failure.
