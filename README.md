# Recursive Paradox Governance

Deterministic governance engine that treats paradox as a conserved quantity across scales.

This repository formalizes **paradox-preservation → paradox-conservation → recursive governance** as a first-class architectural principle.

## Core Idea
Contradictions are not resolved.
They are **tracked, conserved, and propagated** as invariant drivers of adaptive intelligence.

## Scales
- Quantum: measurement contradiction primitives
- Decision: firewalled ambiguity and horizon effects
- Planetary: coherence fields and systemic risk
- ASI: recursive evolution via paradox gradients

## Structure
- paradox_conservation_engine/ — core invariant tracker
- higher_dimensional_horizons/ — recursive boundary geometry
- conserved_contradiction_metrics/ — paradox κ–τ–Σ extensions
- recursive_evolution_demo/ — runnable scaffolds
- integrations/ — links to QMCK, decision-decomposition, ASIOS

This repository governs **through paradox**, not despite it.
