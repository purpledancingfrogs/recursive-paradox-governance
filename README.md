# Recursive Paradox Governance

Deterministic engine for governing conserved contradictions across recursive scales.

## Core Principle
Paradox is a conserved quantity. Systems evolve by sustaining contradiction, not resolving it.

## Layers
- Micro: Quantum measurement contradictions
- Meso: Decision firewalls and ambiguity
- Macro: Planetary coherence fields
- Meta: ASI recursive evolution

## Modules
- paradox_conservation_engine/
- higher_dimensional_horizons/
- conserved_contradiction_metrics/
- recursive_evolution_demo/
- integrations/

## Invariants
Extends ?–t–S with paradox density, persistence, and gradient flow.

## Status
Scaffold initialized.
