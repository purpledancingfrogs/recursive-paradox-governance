# Integrations

Formal integration points connecting **recursive-paradox-governance** to the existing ecosystem.

## Purpose
This module defines **hard interfaces**—not conceptual inspiration—between paradox conservation and the underlying systems that generate, structure, and govern contradiction.

Integrations ensure paradox is **lifted intact** across repositories without reinterpretation or loss.

## Integrated Repositories

### QuantumMeasurementContradictionKit (QMCK)
- Source of quantum contradiction primitives
- Measurement vs. unitary evolution conflicts
- Feeds raw paradox states into conservation engine

### decision-decomposition
- Structured ambiguity and decision firewalls
- Intel firewall horizons as mid-scale paradox containers
- Provides meso-level contradiction fields

### planetary-coherence-OS
- κ–τ–Σ governance constraints
- Systemic risk and temporal responsibility boundaries
- Hosts macro-scale paradox fields

### ASIOS
- Recursive evolution (AGRe)
- Growth constrained by conserved paradox gradients
- Prevents collapse into single-objective ASI

## Interface Contracts
- No semantic reinterpretation of paradox
- Deterministic state handoff only
- Full audit trace across repositories
- Conservation invariants enforced at every boundary

## Data Flow
```

QMCK → decision-decomposition → paradox_conservation_engine
→ higher_dimensional_horizons → planetary-coherence-OS
→ ASIOS (recursive evolution)

```

## Non-Goals
- No duplication of logic
- No new ontology
- No resolution layers
- No optimization loops

This module guarantees the ecosystem operates as **one continuous paradox-governed system**, not a collection of tools.
