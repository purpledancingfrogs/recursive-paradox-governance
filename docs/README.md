# Documentation

Authoritative documentation for **recursive-paradox-governance**.

This directory contains specifications, invariants, and design constraints that define how paradox is **conserved, propagated, and governed** across recursive scales.

## Scope
Documentation here is **normative**, not explanatory.
It defines what *must* hold true for the system to remain valid.

## Contents
- **Invariants** — formal conservation laws for paradox
- **Boundary Conditions** — rules governing horizon crossings
- **Metric Definitions** — Π, ΔΠ, Ξ, Ω semantics and constraints
- **Failure Modes** — what collapse looks like and how it is detected
- **Audit Guarantees** — replayability and trace integrity

## Design Rules
- No resolution narratives
- No optimization framing
- No anthropomorphic language
- No metaphors without enforceable structure

## Relationship to Code
- Code implements the constraints defined here
- Documentation is the source of truth
- If code and docs disagree, code is wrong

This directory anchors the repository as a **governance specification**, not a speculative concept.
