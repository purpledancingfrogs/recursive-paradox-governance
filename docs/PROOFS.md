# Conservation Proof Sketches

## Theorem 1 — Non-Annihilation
Under ParadoxEngine.step, Π(t+1) = Π(t) > 0.

## Theorem 2 — Bounded Coherence
Ξ ∈ [0,1] invariant under horizon nesting.

## Theorem 3 — Scale Lifting
Horizon refraction preserves total paradox mass.

Proofs are constructive and reference engine invariants.
