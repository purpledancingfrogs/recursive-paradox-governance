# Paradox Conservation Invariants

This document defines the core invariants governing recursive paradox preservation.

## Fundamental Principle
Contradictions are conserved quantities, not errors to be resolved.

## Invariants
- Paradox Density (Π): must remain non-zero across scales.
- Paradox Persistence (ρ): contradictions may transform but not collapse.
- Gradient Flow (∇Π): adaptive evolution follows paradox gradients, not utility maximization.

## Scale Invariance
These invariants apply uniformly across:
- Quantum
- Decision-theoretic
- Planetary governance
- ASI evolution
