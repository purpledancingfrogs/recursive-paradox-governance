# Architecture

This system is layered by recursive scale, not by abstraction comfort.

## Layers
1. Quantum / Micro — contradiction primitives
2. Decision / Meso — firewalled choice boundaries
3. Planetary / Macro — coherence fields
4. ASI / Meta — recursive evolution gradients

## Governing Rule
Paradox is conserved across layers.
No layer may eliminate contradiction introduced below it.

## Data Flow
Contradiction → Fragmentation → Boundary → Re-entanglement
