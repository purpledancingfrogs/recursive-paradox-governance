# Recursive Evolution Demo

Runnable demonstrations showing **adaptive evolution driven by conserved paradox**, not optimization or resolution.

## Purpose
This module illustrates how systems evolve **because** contradictions persist.  
Growth occurs through sustained paradox gradients rather than utility maximization.

## What This Demonstrates
- Recursive improvement without convergence
- Stability through irreducible contradiction
- Safe expansion under paradox conservation laws
- Prevention of ideological or objective lock-in

## Demo Scenarios
- **Paradox-Driven ASI Scaffold**  
  A minimal agent that improves internal models while preserving core contradictions.

- **Governance Through Conflict**  
  Policy evolution where disagreement stabilizes outcomes instead of collapsing them.

- **Multi-Scale Propagation**  
  A contradiction introduced at one layer re-emerges coherently at higher layers.

## Mechanics
- Evolution steps are gated by paradox metrics (Π, ΔΠ, Ξ, Ω)
- Transitions violating conservation are rejected
- No terminal “solution” states exist

## Outputs
- Stepwise evolution traces
- Paradox metric timelines
- Horizon-crossing audit logs

## Constraints
- No reward functions
- No convergence targets
- No contradiction resolution

This demo proves that **paradox can govern growth safely** when treated as a conserved invariant.
