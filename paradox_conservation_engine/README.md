# Paradox Conservation Engine

Core deterministic engine responsible for **tracking, conserving, and propagating paradox** as a first-class invariant.

## Purpose
This module formalizes paradox as a conserved quantity rather than an error state.  
Contradictions are neither resolved nor collapsed—they are **measured, bounded, and evolved** across recursive layers.

## Responsibilities
- Represent paradox as a state variable with persistence over time
- Enforce conservation laws across transformations and scale transitions
- Prevent paradox collapse (forced resolution) and paradox blow-up (runaway inconsistency)
- Provide invariant signals to downstream governance layers

## Core Concepts
- **Paradox Density (Π)**: amount of unresolved contradiction within a bounded system
- **Paradox Entropy**: dispersion of contradiction across state space
- **Conservation Law**: Π is preserved under valid system evolution
- **Boundary Conditions**: interfaces where paradox fragments, refracts, or re-entangles

## Engine Outputs
- Time-indexed paradox metrics
- Conservation violation flags
- Stable handoff states for higher-dimensional horizons

## Interfaces
Consumes:
- Quantum contradiction primitives (QMCK)
- Decision-level ambiguity states (decision-decomposition)

Emits:
- Conserved paradox signals to horizon geometry
- Gradient inputs for recursive evolution engines

This engine is **non-optimizing** by design.
It exists to ensure paradox survives transformation intact.
