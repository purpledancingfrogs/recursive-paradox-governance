# Higher-Dimensional Horizons

Recursive boundary geometry where **conserved paradox** is refracted, fragmented, and re-entangled across scales.

## Purpose
This module models **horizons** as invariant-preserving boundaries rather than resolution points.  
Paradox does not end at an interface—it **changes dimensional expression**.

## Responsibilities
- Define horizon surfaces between scales (quantum → decision → planetary → ASI)
- Enforce boundary conditions that preserve paradox continuity
- Control paradox flow without collapse or amplification
- Maintain causal separation while allowing informational coupling

## Core Concepts
- **Horizon Surface**: an n-dimensional boundary with invariant constraints
- **Paradox Refraction**: contradiction splits into complementary projections
- **Entangled Boundaries**: distant horizons remain correlated
- **Firewall Condition**: prevents illicit paradox leakage or forced resolution

## Geometry
- Horizons are modeled as manifolds in extended state space
- Boundary operators map conserved paradox across dimensions
- Topology changes are allowed only if conservation laws hold

## Interfaces
Consumes:
- Conserved paradox states from paradox_conservation_engine

Emits:
- Boundary-conditioned paradox states
- Safe transition envelopes for recursive evolution

This module ensures that **paradox survives crossing scales** without losing structure or meaning.
