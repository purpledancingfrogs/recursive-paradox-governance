# Contributing

This project is specification-first and invariant-driven.

## Contribution Rules
- Do NOT resolve paradoxes.
- Do NOT optimize away contradictions.
- All proposals must preserve invariant paradox density.
- Code must be deterministic, auditable, and reversible.

## What Is Welcome
- Formal models
- Proof sketches
- Interface definitions
- Test harnesses that expose contradictions

## What Is Not
- Heuristic patching
- ML-only black boxes
- Forced convergence
